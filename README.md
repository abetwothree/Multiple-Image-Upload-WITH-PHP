# Multiple Image Upload and storage on server linked to datbase with PHP

PHP code to uploade multiple images to a webserver and save the information to a database while making a six point check to each file uploaded. 

It checks for the following:

Checks to make sure there's no errors in the image upload

Checks to make sure it is an image

Checks to make sure it is a certain type of image

Checks the file size of the image

Checks the file name to limit it to 225 characters

Changes the file name to a fully unique file name to avoid over writing files with same names.

The code is very raw and simple so that it can be copied over and implemented into other systems easily without any added bloatware to get in the way.
